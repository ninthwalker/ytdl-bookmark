## What is this?
It's a docker with Youtube-dl to be used with a Browser bookmark for easy simple downloads.  

## Description
This isn't a GUI.
The idea is to make things fast and simple.  
You are on a youtube page and want the video/music. So you just click your bookmark, and bam! It's downloaded.
